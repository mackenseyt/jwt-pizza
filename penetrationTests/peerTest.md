## Mackensey Thomason attacking Andy Mam

| Item              | Result                                                                 |

| **Target**        | https://pizza.mampizza.click/                      |
| **Classification**| Broken Authentication / JWT Tampering Attempt                                                |
| **Severity**      | 0 (no breach occurred)                                                              |
| **Description**   | A forged JWT was generated to impersonate an admin by modifying the payload. While the token had a valid signature, the server correctly denied access because it checked user ID and roles in the backend database.|
| **Images**        | ![Penetration Test Image](./attempt.png) used JWT.io to try and impersonate and admin.|
| **Corrections**   |No correction needed â€” backend properly validates identity server-side.|
